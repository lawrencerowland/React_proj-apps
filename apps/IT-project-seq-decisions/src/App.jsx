Client Requirement Changes:\n   • Model as a Poisson process for the arrival of new features\n   • Example: New features arrive at rate λ = 0.5 per week\n\n4. Technical Challenges:\n   • Use a discrete probability distribution for different levels of technical difficulty\n   • Example: P(Easy) = 0.6, P(Medium) = 0.3, P(Hard) = 0.1\n\n5.

Resource Allocation Policy:\n   • Allocate developers to tasks based on their skills and the task requirements\n   • Use a matching algorithm to optimize developer-task pairings\n\n3. Overtime Authorization Policy:\n   • IF (project completion percentage < expected completion percentage) AND (remaining budget > 10% of total budget)\n     THEN authorize overtime up to 20% of regular hours\n   • ELSE no overtime authorized\n\n4. Budget Allocation Policy:\n   • Allocate budget to tasks proportionally to their estimated time and complexity\n   • Set aside 20% of the budget for unforeseen issues\n\n5. Risk Mitigation Policy:\n   • IF (risk level > threshold) THEN allocate additional resources to high-risk tasks\n   • Continuously update risk assessments based on new information"

        content: "1. Simulation:\n   • Create a Monte Carlo simulation of the project using the uncertainty model\n   • Run the simulation multiple times with different policies\n   • Collect statistics on project outcomes (completion time, budget usage, quality metrics)\n\n2. Sensitivity Analysis:\n   • Vary key parameters (e.g., team size, budget, project duration) to test policy robustness\n   • Identify which factors have the most significant impact on project success\n\n3. Comparative Analysis:\n   • Compare the performance of different policies across various metrics\n   • Use visualization tools (e.g., bar charts, radar charts) to illustrate policy trade-offs\n\n4. Historical Data Validation:\n   • Test policies against data from past projects to assess their effectiveness\n   • Calibrate model parameters based on historical performance\n\n5. Iterative Improvement:\n   • Use machine learning techniques to refine policies based on simulation results\n   • Implement the best-performing policies in real projects and gather feedback\n   • Continuously update and improve policies based on new data and insights"
